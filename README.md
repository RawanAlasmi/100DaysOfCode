## Why JavaScript?
<img src="JavaScript/javascript.jpg" alt="JavaScript">

JavaScript has become increasingly important in the front-end world. While it was once used mainly to make pages dynamic, it is now the foundation of many front-end frameworks. These frameworks handle a lot of the tasks that were formerly handled by the back-end (e.g., routing and displaying different views).
